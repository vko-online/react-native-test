## Simplified version

Did not install any package. Used what is given.

- used `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` for requests, as `https://reqres.in/` doesn't have enough data for showing pagination
- added `react/prop-types` to eslint for simplicity
- added `react/jsx-filename-extension` to allow using JSX in js file
